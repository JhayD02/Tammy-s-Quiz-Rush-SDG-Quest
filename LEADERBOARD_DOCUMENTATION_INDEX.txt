TIPS FOR SUCCESS:
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. READ THE ENTIRE README.md FIRST
   Don't just skim - understand the full flow before starting

2. HAVE TWO WINDOWS OPEN
   Window 1: Documentation (on one monitor)
   Window 2: Unity (on other monitor)
   OR split your screen

3. FOLLOW STEP-BY-STEP
   Don't skip steps. Each one builds on the previous

4. SAVE FREQUENTLY
   Ctrl+S after each section

5. USE COPY-PASTE
   Copy scene names, text field names exactly to avoid errors

6. CHECK CONSOLE FOR ERRORS
   Window → General → Console (Ctrl + `)
   This shows any problems as they happen

7. USE LeaderboardDebugHelper FOR TESTING
   Don't play the full quiz repeatedly
   Generate test data with the helper buttons

8. VERIFY EACH PART BEFORE MOVING TO NEXT
   Test results panel works before making leaderboard scene

9. DOUBLE-CHECK SCENE NAMES
   They are CASE SENSITIVE:
   "MainMenu" not "mainmenu"
   "Quiz Scene Proper" not "Quiz Scene proper"
   "Leaderboard" not "leaderboard"

10. WHEN IN DOUBT, CHECK THE SCRIPTS
    Look at LocalLeaderboardManager.cs to see what it expects
    Read the [SerializeField] labels in the Inspector
